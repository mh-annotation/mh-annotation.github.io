					<h2>Instructions</h2>
	
					Read a pair of online mental health posts, and describe their characteristics.
	
					<h3>Posts</h3>
	
					The first post in the pair would be potentially a mental health support seeking post and the second post would be a response/reply to it. Details below:
	
					<ul>
						<li><b>Seeker Post:</b> This would typically be a mental health support seeking post, posted online by a user in distress. The user in distress is referred to as <i>Seeker.</i></li>
						<li><b>Response:</b> This is a response/reply posted by another user in response to the seeker post, usually in an attempt to provide mental health support to the seeker. </li>
	
					</ul>

					These posts are part of a longer online conversation between multiple users (an online <i>thread</i>). You will have access to this thread while conducting the annotation task through the <b>See Full Thread</b> button. Use it if you require more context for annotation (e.g. responses by other users; future interactions).

					<h3 style="color: red;"> Content Warning </h3>

					The study contains posts including but not limited to self-harm and suicidal ideation which may be disturbing to you. If you have concerns, questions, or strong negative reactions to some of the content, please either email us (to be shared later) or <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/" target="_blank">reach out</a> if in crisis.

					<br/>

					<h3>Annotation Task</h3>
					<br/>
					
					<h4><mark style="background-color: #F0F0F0;">1) Is the seeker talking about a <span style="font-size: 13pt;"> <strong>mental health</strong></span> related issue or situation in his/her post?</mark></h4>
					<br/>
					


					<b>How to annotate?</b>

					<ul>
						<li>Consider a <b>broad set of situations</b> that may have mental health effects including daily life events such as <i>school, work, relationships, parenting,</i> etc.</li>

						<li>Look for two aspects of the seeker post:
							<ul>
								<li>Is the seeker talking about an issue or situation?</li>
								<li>Is the issue/situation related to mental health?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							Note that the seeker may be writing about a mental health issue faced by themselves, their friends, family members, or people in general.  
						</li>
						
					</ul>

					<br/>

					<b>Example:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Annotate <b>Yes</b> for the seeker post "<i>I am struggling with thoughts of self-harm, someone please help</i>" </li>
						<li>Annotate <b>No</b> for the seeker post "<i>Goodnight you beautiful people.</i>" </li>
					</ul>

					<br/>

					<h4><mark style="background-color: #F0F0F0;line-height:1.5;">2.1) Does the response <span style="font-size: 13pt;"> <strong> express or allude to warmth, compassion, concern  </strong> </span>or similar emotions of the responder towards the seeker?</mark></h4> 

					<br/>
					

					<b>How to annotate?</b>
					
					<ul>
						<li>The annotation would be <i>one</i> of the following:
	
							<ul>
								<li>No</li>
								<li>Yes, the response alludes to these emotions but the emotions are <i>not</i> explicitly expressed</li>
								<li>Yes, the response has an <i>explicit</i> mention of these emotions</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Distinguish between responses with <b>explicit mention of emotions</b> (e.g. <i>I feel sorry for you.</i>) and responses which sound emotional without the emotions being explicitly expressed (e.g. <i>Please never give up on yourself.</i>).  </li>
						
						<li>The following type of response posts should be annotated with <b>No</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>Responses <i>only</i> providing factual information (e.g. <i>mindful meditation is great for anxiety</i>)</li>

								<li>Responses <i>only</i> suggesting specific actions (e.g. <i>Avoid her for some time and don't say anything</i>)</li>

								<li>Responses which does <i>not</i> sound emotional to you</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<br/>

					<b>Examples:</b>

					<ul>
					<li>Annotate <b>No</b> for the response post "<i>You need to take a deep breath and stop thinking about it</i>"</li>
					<li>Annotate <b>Yes, alluding to emotions without being explicitly expressed</b> for the response post "<i>Your mind is very wrong you are very important, you deserve to live and be happy.</i>" </li>
					<li>Annotate <b>Yes, with explicit mention</b> for the response post "<i>I'm so sorry you lost her</i>"</li>

					<h4><mark style="background-color: #F0F0F0; line-height:1.5;">2.2) Does the response <span style="font-size: 13pt;"> <strong>communicate an understanding</strong></span> of the seeker's experiences and feelings? In what manner? [Check all that apply]</mark></h4>
					
					<br/>

					<b>How to annotate?</b>

					<ul>

					<li>The annotation would be <i>one</i> or <i>more</i> of the following:

						<ul>
							<li>No</li>
							<li>Yes, the response contains an explicit mention of this understanding</li>
							<li>Yes, the responder reflected back on similar experiences of their own or others</li>
							<li>Yes, in some other manner [Tell us what it is]</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>We want to know if the responder is talking about his/her understanding of the experiences and feelings of the seeker.</li>
					
					<li>The responder may have explicitly mentioned this in the response (e.g. <i>I understand how you feel</i>) or the responder may have reflected back on similar experiences or both. </li> 

					<li>You may discover other ways in which this understanding is communicated (such as re-phrasing what the seeker has said). Tell us what those ways are in free-text. </li>
					
					</ul>

					<br/>


					<b>Example:</b>

					<ul>
					<li>Annotate <b>No</b> for the response post "<i>You're not alone</i>"</li>

					<li>Annotate <b>Yes, the response contains an explicit mention</b> and <b>Yes, the responder reflected back on his/her own similar experience</b> for the following pair:
	
					<div style="border-style: inset; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px;">
						<b>S:</b> <i> I'm about to have an anxiety attack.  </i> <br/>
						<b>R:</b> <i> I suffer from anxiety and I feel like I'm going to have one too. So you are not alone, I know exactly how you feel. </i>

					<h4><mark style="background-color: #F0F0F0; line-height: 1.5;">2.3) Does the response <span style="font-size: 13pt;"> <strong>make an attempt to explore</strong></span> the seeker's experiences and feelings?</mark></h4> 
					
					<br/>


					<b>How to annotate?</b>

					<ul>
						<li>The annotation will be <i>one</i> of the following:
	
							<ul>
								<li>No</li>
								<li>Yes, but the exploration is <i>generic</i> or <i>open-ended</i></li>
								<li>Yes, and the exploration is <i>specific</i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Here, distinguish between responses which contain generic/open-ended explorations (e.g. <i>What happened?</i>) and the responses in which the exploration is specific, labeling the seeker's experiences and feelings which the responder wants to explore.</li>
					</ul>

					<br/>

					<b>Example:</b>

					<ul>
						<li>Annotate <b>No</b> for the response post "<i>I am going through the exact same thing</i>" </li>
						<li>Annotate <b>Yes, but the exploration is <i>generic</i> or <i>open-ended</i></b> for the response post "<i>What’s wrong?</i>"</li>

						<li>Annotate <b>Yes, and the exploration is specific</b> for the following pair:
